# Data-Visualization-challenge

Utilizing Pandas, Matplotlib and ScyPy to analyze trail data for the following:

You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

Instructions

This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:
Prepare the data.
Generate summary statistics.
Create bar charts and pie charts.
Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
Calculate correlation and regression.
Submit your final analysis.

To acheive these results i used techniques such as groupby, pd.merge, pandas, and other coding utlized through python learning. 

References, outside of utilizing various course content and online resources for reviewing syntax. I used ChatGPT to help me understand in depth the sytanx needed and the code in general more thouroughly. I also used outside resources to make sure I was following a proper train of thought. I cannot directly reference any of these resources as code was not fully pulled but used more as a guide to clean up or correct the work to achieve the results.
